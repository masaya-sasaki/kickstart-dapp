# Smart Contract Development Practice: KickStarter Contract
This project is a practice of developing smart contracts. 
I used the basic ideas from the kickstarter contract in the Udemy course below by Stephen Grider but instead of using previous versions of solidity in the course and Truffle, I used newer updated versions of solidity and Hardhat. The contract is deployed to the Goerli test network on Ethereum.Contract deployed to address: 0xF04e6744F9C47022c439754F8a0dEa6De3eE7597

Based on Stephen Grider's course "Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide"
